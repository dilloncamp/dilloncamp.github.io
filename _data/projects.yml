    Detecting Credit Card Fraud with Cloud Computing
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    I use Python on a Google Compute virtual machine to analyze anonymized credit card transactions and successfully detect fraud with an F1 score of 85.68 and an accuracy of 99.96% (compared to a baseline accuracy of 99.83% when predicting that no transactions are fraudulent).
